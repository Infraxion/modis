# MODIS

Latest release: [v0.4.0 Beta](https://github.com/Infraxion/modis/releases/tag/0.4.0)

## About Modis

Modis is a Discord bot that runs with a graphical UI and is designed to be both easy to host and easy to customise. Anyone with some basic Python knowledge can quickly and easily create new bot modules, while Modis' extensive library of internal APIs makes creating complex modules with embed UIs and permissioned message commands a breeze for experienced developers. Anyone familiar with the discord.py library will be able to pick up Modis module development in seconds.

For those who aren't interested in development, Modis' graphical console window makes hosting your own fully featured Discord bot easy and fun, with the stock modules providing incredible features such as the music module's in-channel graphical interface, complete with progress bars and buttons.

## ModisWorks Modules

ModisWorks develops 4 core modules for Modis that will give you base functionality for your bot.
- `!core` - Manages all the behind the scenes stuff that runs the internal APIs the modules use. Be careful not to remove this module! A lot of other modules need this module to work properly.
- `help` - Modis with a bunch of modules becomes a big bot very quickly, so this module helps to alleviate the learning cliff by allowing easy access to command definitions inside Discord.
- `manager` - Provides essential server management tools for server owners, such as activating and deactivating modules, changing the command prefix, and various moderation tools.
- `music` - Modis' flagship module - a music player featuring a live-updating GUI with a progress bar, queue display, and more. The GUI also has working media buttons for easy control without needing to know any commands. The player supports songs and playlists for YouTube, Spotify, and SoundCloud, and can play most online audio sources.

We also make a bunch of other modules to show off what you can do with Modis:
- `bethebot` - Modis can't really have conversations with your server members, but you can fake it by taking control!
- `hex` - Visually displays hex colours if it sees them in your messages. Handy for graphic designers and programmers.
- `gamedeals` - Posts current hot posts above an upvote threshold of a particular subreddit. It's set to /r/gamedeals by default so you can make sure you don't miss any sales!
- `replies` - Allows server owners to easily set the bot to reply to specific phrases.
- `rocketleague` - Looks up your Rocket League rank and stats; currently supported for Steam, XBox, and PS4 players.
- `tableflip` - The best module.

More detailed information about each module and how to use them can be found in the [docs](https://infraxion.github.io/modis/documentation/#modules).

## Third-Party Modules

Modis has a module downloader built in that can pull modules from GitHub repos and automatically install them. Here's a list of developers with their own module libraries that you can download and try:
